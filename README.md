Pi-Data-Logger
==============

For Data Logging from a go cart on a RPi

The original intnetion is that there will be several sensors on a go cart logging RPM, G-Forces, Temperature etc
This will be logged onto a memory stick,
When the cart pit stops the memory stick will be swapped so the data can be transfered. at some point wireless transfer would be nice!!
